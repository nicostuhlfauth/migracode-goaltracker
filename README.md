## React Learning Repo - Possible solution for goals tracker

As part of the React class I teach at MigraCode Barcelona, I've asked the students to create a goals tracker using React and useState. This component serves as a solution they can refer to as they learn how to implement useState in their projects.

### The goals tracker component allows users to:

- View a list of goals.
- Toggle the completion status of each goal.
- Add new goals to the list.
- Delete goals from the list.

### How to Use

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.

- Experiment with the code to understand how React's useState hook is used.
- Test the component by running the application (`npm start`) and interact with it in your browser.
